\description{
\code{tmx_genotypic_effect} allows you to explore the concept of genotypic effect at a locus.

\code{d} and \code{h} are the incremental effects of the allele difference \code{B – b}. The \code{Bb} phenotype may lie on either
side of \code{m} and the sign of \code{h} will vary accordingly; in the case illustrated \code{h} would be negative.
(Adapted from Mather and Jinks, 1977, p. 32). See book issue #23

This function lets you explore the simplest two–allele system (\code{B} and \code{b}), with three possible genotypes, \code{BB}, \code{Bb}, and \code{bb}.
Parameter "b" is half the measured difference between the homozygotes \code{BB} and \code{bb}. The point between the two homozygotes
is "m" -- the mean effect of the homozygous genotypes. "d" defines the measured deviation effect of the heterozygote \code{Aa},
relative to this expected midpoint. "a" and "d" are genotypic effects.

Old system:

\code{u} = Frequency of the dominant allele (now = \code{p}).
\code{v} = Frequency of the recessive allele (now = \code{q}).

\code{m} = midpoint between the two homozygotes
\code{d} = half the difference between the two homozygote (now \code{a})

\code{h} = deviation of the heterozygote from \code{m} (now = \code{d})

New system:

\code{u} and \code{v} -> \code{p} and  \code{q}

\code{d} and \code{h} -> \code{a} and \code{d}
