\description{
Make a 2-group Common Pathway twin model (Common-factor common-pathway multivariate model).
}
\details{
The common-pathway model provides a powerful tool for theory-based decomposition of genetic
and environmental differences.

umxCP supports this with pairs of mono-zygotic (MZ) and di-zygotic (DZ) twins reared together
to model the genetic and environmental structure of multiple phenotypes
(measured behaviors).

Common-pathway path diagram:

\figure{CP.png}

As can be seen, each phenotype also by default has A, C, and E influences specific to that phenotype.


Like the \code{\link{umxACE}} model, the CP model decomposes phenotypic variance
into Additive genetic, unique environmental (E) and, optionally, either
common or shared-environment (C) or 
non-additive genetic effects (D).

Unlike the Cholesky, these factors do not act directly on the phenotype. Instead latent A, 
C, and E influences impact on one or more latent factors which in turn account for variance in the phenotypes (see Figure below).


\strong{Data Input}
Currently, the umxCP function accepts only raw data. This may change in future versions.

\strong{Ordinal Data}
In an important capability, the model transparently handles ordinal (binary or multi-level
ordered factor data) inputs, and can handle mixtures of continuous, binary, and ordinal
data in any combination.

\strong{Additional features}
The umxCP function supports varying the DZ genetic association (defaulting to .5)
to allow exploring assortative mating effects, as well as varying the DZ \dQuote{C} factor
from 1 (the default for modeling family-level effects shared 100% by twins in a pair),
to .25 to model dominance effects.

\strong{Matrices and Labels in CP model}
A good way to see which matrices are used in umxCP is to run an example model and plot it.

Matrices as, cs, and es contain the variable-specifc path loadings on their diagonal. So labels relevant to modifying these are of the form "as_r1c1", "as_r2c2" etc.
All the shared matrices are in the model "top". So to see the  as values, you can simply execute:

m1$top#as$values

The common-pathway loadings on the factors are in matrices a_cp, c_cp, e_cp.

The common factors themselves are in the matrix cp_loadings (an nVar * 1 matrix)

Less commonly-modified matrices are the mean matrix `expMean`. This has 1 row, and the columns are laid out for each variable for twin 1, followed by each variable for twin 2.
So, in a model where the means for twin 1 and twin 2 had been equated (set = to T1), you could make them independent again with this script:

m1$top$expMean$labels[1,4:6] =  c("expMean_r1c4", "expMean_r1c5", "expMean_r1c6")
}
\examples{
require(umx)
data(twinData) 
twinData$wt1 = twinData$wt1/10 # help CSOLNP by putting wt on a similar scale to ht
twinData$wt2 = twinData$wt2/10 # help CSOLNP by putting wt on a similar scale to ht
selDVs = c("ht", "wt")
mzData <- subset(twinData, zygosity == "MZFF")
dzData <- subset(twinData, zygosity == "DZFF")
umx_set_optimizer("SLSQP") # preferably NPSOL: CSOLNP needs setup to run this model.
m1 = umxCP(selDVs = selDVs, dzData = dzData, mzData = mzData, suffix = "")
umxSummary(m1)
umxParameters(m1, patt = "^c")
m2 = umxModify(m1, regex = "(cs_.*$)|(c_cp_)", name = "dropC")
umxSummaryCP(m2, comparison = m1, file = NA)
umxCompare(m1, m2)
