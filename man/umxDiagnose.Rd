\title{Diagnose problems in a model - this is a work in progress.}
\usage{
umxDiagnose(model, tryHard = FALSE, diagonalizeExpCov = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an \code{\link[=mxModel]{mxModel()}} to diagnose}

\item{tryHard}{whether I should try and fix it? (defaults to FALSE)}

\item{diagonalizeExpCov}{Whether to diagonalize the ExpCov}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item helpful messages and perhaps a modified model
}
}
\description{
The goal of this function is to diagnose problems in a model and return suggestions to the user.
It is a work in progress, and of no use as yet.
}
\details{
Best diagnostics are:
\enumerate{
\item observed data variances and means
\item expected variances and means
3 Difference of these?
}

Try
* diagonalizeExpCov diagonal.
* umx_any_ordinal()

more tricky - we should really report the variances and the standardized thresholds.

require(umx)
