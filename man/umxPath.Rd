\arguments{
\item{from}{either a source variable e.g "A" or c("A","B"), OR a sem-style path description, e.g. "A-> B" or "C <> B"}

\item{to}{one or more target variables for one-headed paths, e.g "A" or c("A","B")}

\item{with}{same as "to = vars, arrows = 2". nb: from, to= and var=  must be left empty (their default)}

\item{var}{equivalent to setting "from = vars, arrows = 2". nb: from, to, and with must be left empty (their default)}

\item{cov}{equivalent to setting "from = X, to = Y, arrows = 2". nb: from, to, and with must be left empty (their default)}

\item{unique.bivariate}{equivalent to setting "connect = "unique.bivariate", arrows = 2".
nb: from, to, and with must be left empty (their default)}

\item{unique.pairs}{equivalent to setting "connect = "unique.pairs", arrows = 2" (don't use from, to, or with)}

\item{forms}{Paired with from, this will build a formative variable. from vars form the latent.
Latent variance is fixed at 0. Loading of path 1 is fixed at 1. unique.bivariate among froms.}

\item{Cholesky}{Treat \strong{Cholesky} vars as latent and \strong{to} as measured, and connect as in an ACE model.}

\item{defn}{latent variable, var@0 mean fixed, with label-based as data source}

\item{means}{equivalent to "from = 'one', to = x. nb: from, to, with and var must be left empty (their default).}

\item{v1m0}{variance of 1 and mean of zero in one call.}

\item{v.m.}{variance and mean, both free.}

\item{v0m0}{variance and mean, both fixed at zero.}

\item{fixedAt}{Equivalent to setting "free = FALSE, values = x" nb: free and values must be left empty (their default)}

\item{freeAt}{Equivalent to setting "free = TRUE, values = x" nb: free and values must be left empty (their default)}

\item{firstAt}{first value is fixed at this (values passed to free are ignored: warning if not a single TRUE)}

\item{connect}{as in mxPath - nb: Only used when using from and to}

\item{arrows}{as in mxPath - nb: Only used when using from and to}

\item{free}{whether the value is free to be optimised}

\item{values}{default value list}

\item{labels}{labels for each path}

\item{lbound}{lower bounds for each path value}

\item{ubound}{upper bounds for each path value}

\item{hasMeans}{Used in 'forms' case to know whether the data have means or not.}

\description{
The goal of this function is to enable quck-to-write, quick-to-read, flexible path descriptions for RAM models in OpenMx.

It introduces 14 new words to our vocabulary for describing paths: \strong{with}, \strong{var}, \strong{cov}, \strong{unique.bivariate}, \strong{unique.pairs}, \strong{Cholesky}, \strong{defn}, \strong{means}, \strong{v1m0}, \strong{v1m0}, \strong{v.m.}, \strong{fixedAt}, \strong{freeAt}, \strong{firstAt}.

The new preposition \dQuote{with} means you no-longer need set arrows = 2 on covariances. Instead, you can say:

   \code{umxPath(A, with = B)} instead of \code{mxPath(from = A, to = B, arrows = 2)}.

Specify a variance for A with

\code{umxPath(var = "A")}.

This is equivalent to \code{mxPath(from = "A", to = "A", arrows = 2)}.

Of course you can use vectors anywhere:

\code{umxPath(var = c('N','E', 'O'))}

To specify a mean, you just say

\code{umxPath(mean = "A")}, which is equivalent to \code{mxPath(from = "one", to = "A")}.

To fix a path at a value, instead of to \code{mxPath(from = A, to = A, arrows = 2, free = FALSE, values = 1)} you can say:

\code{umxPath(var = "A", fixedAt = 1)} .

The common task of creating a variable with variance fixed at 1 and mean at 0 is done thus:

\code{umxPath(v1m0 = "A")}

For free variance and means use:

\code{umxPath(v.m. = "A")}

umxPath exposes \dQuote{unique.bivariate} so you don't have to remember
how to fill in connect = in mxPath (you can still use connect if you wish).

So, to create paths A<->B, B<->C, and A<->C, you would say:

\code{umxPath(unique.bivariate = c('A',"B","C"))}

Setting up a latent trait, you can fix the loading of the first path with

\code{mxPath(A, to = c(B,C,D), fixFirst = TRUE)}  

This is equivalent to \code{mxPath(from = A, to = c(B,C,D), free = c(F, T, T), values = c(1, .5, .4))}.

A new feature is the ability to create Cholesky-pattern connections:

\code{umxPath(Cholesky = c("A1", "A2"), to c("var1", "var2"))}

Finally, a feature, not implemented in this release, but intended for the future is
John Fox "sem"-package style notation,

i.e., "A -> B; X <-> B; "
}
\details{
This function returns a standard mxPath, but gives new options for specifying the path. In addition to the normal
\dQuote{from} and \dQuote{to}, it adds specialised parameters for variances (var), two headed paths (with) and means (mean).
There are also new terms to describe fixing values: \dQuote{fixedAt} and \dQuote{fixFirst}.

Finally, (in future) it will allow sem-style \dQuote{A->B} string specification.
