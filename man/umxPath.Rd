\arguments{
\item{from}{either a source variable e.g "A" or c("A","B"), OR a sem-style path description, e.g. "A-> B" or "C <> B"}

\item{to}{one or more target variables for one-headed paths, e.g "A" or c("A","B")}

\item{with}{same as "to = vars, arrows = 2". nb: from, to= and var=  must be left empty (their default)}

\item{var}{equivalent to setting "from = vars, arrows = 2". nb: from, to, and with must be left empty (their default)}

\item{cov}{equivalent to setting "from = X, to = Y, arrows = 2". nb: from, to, and with must be left empty (their default)}

\item{unique.bivariate}{equivalent to setting "connect = "unique.bivariate", arrows = 2". nb: from, to, and with must be left empty (their default)}

\item{formative}{Paired with to, this will build a formative variable, from the formatives, allowing these to
covary, and to the latent "to" variable, fixing its variance to zero.}

\item{Cholesky}{Treat the \strong{from} vars as latent and \strong{to} as measured, and connect up as in an ACE model.}

\item{means}{equivalent to "from = 'one', to = x. nb: from, to, with and var must be left empty (their default).}

\item{v1m0}{variance of 1 and mean of zero in one call.}

\item{fixedAt}{Equivalent to setting "free = FALSE, values = x" nb: free and values must be left empty (their default)}

\item{freeAt}{Equivalent to setting "free = TRUE, values = x" nb: free and values must be left empty (their default)}

\item{firstAt}{first value is fixed at this (values passed to free are ignored: warning if not a single TRUE)}

\item{connect}{as in mxPath - nb: Only used when using from and to}

\item{arrows}{as in mxPath - nb: Only used when using from and to}

\item{free}{whether the value is free to be optimised}

\item{values}{default value list}

\item{labels}{labels for each path}

\item{lbound}{lower bounds for each path value}

\item{ubound}{upper bounds for each path value}

\description{
The goal of this function is to enable quck-to-write, quick-to-read, flexible path descriptions for RAM models in OpenMx.

It introduces 10 new verbs: \strong{with}, \strong{var}, \strong{cov}, \strong{unique.bivariate}, \strong{Cholesky}, \strong{means}, \strong{v1m0}, \strong{fixedAt}, \strong{freeAt}, \strong{firstAt}.

The new key "with" means you no-longer need set arrows = 2 on covariances. So you can say:

   \code{umxPath(A, with = B)} instead of \code{mxPath(from = A, to = B, arrows = 2)}.

Specify a variance for A with

\code{umxPath(var = A)}.

This is equivalent to \code{mxPath(from = A, to = A, arrows = 2)}.

To specify a mean, you just say

\code{umxPath(mean = A)}, which is equivalent to \code{mxPath(from = "one", to = A)}.

To fix a path at a value, instead of to \code{mxPath(from = A, to = A, arrows = 2, free = FALSE, values = 1)} you can say:

\code{umxPath(var = A, fixedAt = 1)} .

The common task of creating a variable with variance fixed at 1 and mean at 0, you can simply say:

\code{umxPath(v1m0 = A)}

umxPath exposes unique.parameter as a parameter so you don't have remember how to fill in connect= in mxPath
All unique bivariate paths can be specified using unique.bivariate

\code{umxPath(c('A',"B","C"), unique.bivariate = TRUE)} to create paths A<->B, B<->C, and A<->C.

Finally, you can create \emph{Cholesky} form paths (see \code{\link{umxACE}})

\code{umxPath(c("A1", "A2"), to c("var1", "var2"), Cholesky = TURE)}

Setting up a latent trait, you can fix the loading of the first path with

\code{mxPath(A, to = c(B,C,D), fixFirst = TRUE)}

This is equivalent to \code{mxPath(from = A, to = c(B,C,D), free = c(F, T, T), values = c(1, .5, .4))}.

Finally, in the future I will implement the John Fox "sem" package style notation, i.e., "A -> B".
If you want to add multiple paths that way, separate them with a semi-colon or a return (see examples below.)
}
\details{
This function returns a standard mxPath, but gives new options for specifying the path. In addition to the normal
from and to, it adds specialised parameters for variances (var), two headed paths (with) and means (mean).
There are also verbs for fixing values: "fixedAt" and "fixFirst"
Finally, it also allows sem-style "A->B" string specification.

umxPath(means = c("A","B")) # Create a means model for A: from = "one", to = "A"

# A worked example
data(demoOneFactor)
latents  = c("G")
manifests = names(demoOneFactor)
myData = mxData(cov(demoOneFactor), type = "cov", numObs = 500)
m1 <- umxRAM("One Factor", data = myData,
	umxPath(latents, to = manifests),
	# umxPath("G -> manifests"),
	umxPath(var = manifests),
	umxPath(var = latents, fixedAt = 1.0)
)
m1 = mxRun(m1)
umxSummary(m1, show = "std")
#umxPath("A <-> B") # same path as above using a string
#umxPath("A -> B") # one-headed arrow with string syntax
#umxPath("A <> B; A <-- B") # This is ok too
#umxPath("A -> B; B>C; C --> D") # two paths. white space and hyphens not needed
## manifests is a reserved word, as is latents.
## It allows the string syntax to use the manifestVars variable
#umxPath("A -> manifests")
