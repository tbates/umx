\item{comparison}{Compare the new model to the old (if updating an existing model: default = TRUE)}

\item{setValues}{Whether to generate likely good start values (Defaults to TRUE)}

\item{suffix}{String to append to each label (useful if model will be used in a multi-group model)}

\item{independent}{Whether the model is independent (default = NA)}

\item{remove_unused_manifests}{Whether to remove variables in the data to which no path makes reference (defaults to TRUE)}

\item{showEstimates}{Whether to show estimates. Defaults to no (alternatives = "raw", "std", etc.)}

\item{autoRun}{Whether to mxRun the model (default TRUE: the estimated model will be returned)}

\item{type}{One of 'Auto','FIML','cov', 'cor', 'WLS','DWLS', or 'ULS'. Auto reacts to the incoming mxData type (raw/cov, WLS). FIML requires that the data are continuous. Remaining options are weighted, diagonally weighted, or unweighted least squares, respectively)}

\description{
\code{umxRAM} expedites creation of path-based models, still without doing invisible things to the model.

Here's an example that makes a model of miles per gallon (mpg) as a function of weight (wt) and engine displacement (disp)
using \code{mtcars} data.\preformatted{m1 = umxRAM("tim", data = mtcars,
	umxPath(c("wt", "disp"), to = "mpg"),
	umxPath("wt", with = "disp"),
	umxPath(v.m. = c("wt", "disp", "mpg"))
)
}

As you can see, most of the work is done by \code{\link[=umxPath]{umxPath()}}. \code{umxRAM} just wraps these paths up, takes the \code{data =} input, and
then internally sets up all the labels and start values for the model, runs it, displays a summary, and a plot!

Try it, or one of the several models in the examples at the bottom of this page.

A common error is to include data in the main list, a bit like
saying \code{lm(y ~ x + df)} instead of \code{lm(y ~ x, data = dd)}.

\strong{nb}: Because it uses the presence of a variable in the data to detect if a variable is latent or not, umxRAM needs data at build time.

\emph{note}: If you are at the "sketching" stage of theory consideration, \code{umxRAM} supports
a simple vector of manifest names to work with.\preformatted{m1 = umxRAM("sketch", data = c("A", "B", "C"),
	umxPath("A", to = "B"),
	umxPath("B", with = "C"),
	umxPath(v.m. = c("A", "B", "C"))
)
}

Will create this figure:

\if{latex}{\figure{sketch.pdf}{options: width=7cm}}
}
\details{
\strong{Comparison with mxModel)}

umxRAM differs from mxModel in the following ways:
\enumerate{
\item{You don't need to set type = "RAM"}
\item{You don't need to list manifestVars (they are detected from path usage)}
\item{You don't need to list latentVars (detected as anything in paths but not in \code{mxData})}
\item{You add data like you do in \code{\link{lm}}, with \strong{data = }}
\item{with \code{\link{umxPath}} you can use powerful verbs like \strong{var = }}
\item{You don't need to add labels: paths are automatically labelled "a_to_b" etc.}
\item{You don't need to set start values, they will be done for you.}
\item{You don't need to mxRun the model: it will run automatically, and print a summary}
\item{You don't need to run summary: weith autoRun, it will print a summary.}
\item{You get a plot of the model.}
}

\strong{Comparison with other software}

\strong{Start values}. Currently, manifest variable means are set to the observed means, residual variances are set to 80%
of the observed variance of each variable,
and single-headed paths are set to a positive starting value (currently .9).
\emph{note}: The start-value strategy is subject to improvement, and will be documented in the help for umxRAM.

\strong{Blackbox/default or auto-added paths}.
Some other SEM software does a lot of behind-the-scenes defaulting and path addition. I've explored
similar features (like auto-creating error and exogenous variances using \code{endog.variances = TRUE}
and \code{exog.variances = TRUE}). Also identification helpers like \code{fix = "latents"}
and \code{fix = "firstLoadings"}.

To be honest, these are not only more trouble than they are worth, they encourage errors and
poor modeling. I suggest user learn the handful of \code{\link{umxPath}}
short cuts and stay clean and explicit!
