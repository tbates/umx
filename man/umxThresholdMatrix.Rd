umxThresholdMatrix(

\arguments{
\item{df}{The data being modeled (to allow access to the factor levels and quantiles within these for each variable)}

\item{selDVs}{The variable names. Note for twin data, just the base names, which sep will be used to fill out.}

\item{sep}{(e.g. "_T") Required for wide (twin) data. It is used to break the base names our from their numeric suffixes.}

\item{method}{How to implement the thresholds: auto (the default), Mehta, which fixes the first two (auto chooses this for ordinal) or "allFree" (auto chooses this for binary)}

\item{threshMatName}{name of the matrix which is returned. Defaults to "threshMat" - best not to change it.}

\item{l_u_bound}{c(NA, NA) by default, you can use this to bound the first (base) threshold.}

\item{droplevels}{Whether to drop levels with no observed data (defaults to FALSE)}

\item{verbose}{How much to say about what was done. (defaults to FALSE)}

\description{
High-level helper for ordinal modeling. Creates, labels, and sets smart-starts for this complex matrix. Big time saver!
}
\details{
We often need to model ordinal data: sex, low-med-hi, depressed/normal, etc.,
A useful conceptual strategy to handle these data is to build a standard model for normally-varying data
and then to threshold this normal distribution to generate the observed data. Thus an observation of "depressed"
is modeled as a high score on the latent normally distributed trait, with thresholds set so that only scores above
this threshold (1-minus the number of categories) reach the criteria for the diagnosis.

Making this work can require fixing the first 2 thresholds of ordinal data, or fixing both the mean and variance of
a latent variable driving binary data, in order to estimate its one-free parameter: where to place the single threshold
separating low from high cases.

The function returns a 3-item list consisting of:
\enumerate{
\item A thresholdsAlgebra (named \code{threshMatName})
\item A matrix of deviations for the thresholds (\code{deviations_for_thresh})
\item A lower matrix of ones (\code{lowerOnes_for_thresh})
}

\emph{Twin Data}

With twin data, make sure to provide the \strong{full names} for twin data... this is not standard I know...

For twins (the function currently handles only pairs), the thresholds are equated for both twins using labels:

$labels\preformatted{  obese_T1         obese_T2
}

dev_1 "obese_dev1"   "obese_dev1"
}
\examples{
# ============================
# = Simple non-twin examples =
# ============================
# One ordered factor with 2-levels
x = data.frame(ordered(rbinom(100,1,.5))); names(x) <- c("x")
tmp = umxThresholdMatrix(x, selDVs = "x")
# The lower ones matrix (all fixed)
tmp[[1]]$values

# The deviations matrix
tmp[[2]]$values
tmp[[2]]$labels # note labels are equated across twins

# The algebra that assembles these into thresholds:
tmp[[3]]$formula

# Example of a warning to not omit the variable names
# tmp = umxThresholdMatrix(x)
# Just a polite message, but for coding safety, I recommend calling
# umxThresholdMatrix with the names of the variables in the model.
#   Next time, please include selDVs (AND you MUST include sep if this is a twin model!!)

# One ordered factor with 5-levels
x = cut(rnorm(100), breaks = c(-Inf,.2,.5, .7, Inf)); levels(x) = 1:5
x = data.frame(ordered(x)); names(x) <- c("x")
tmp = umxThresholdMatrix(x, selDVs = "x")

tmp = umxThresholdMatrix(x, selDVs = "x", l_u_bound= c(-1,1))
