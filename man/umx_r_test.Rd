\title{Test the difference between correlations for significance.}
\usage{
umx_r_test(data = NULL, vars = vars, alternative = c("two.sided",
  "greater", "less"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the dataset}

\item{vars}{the 4 vars needed: "j & k" and "h & m"}

\item{alternative}{two (default) or one-sided (greater less) test}
}
\value{
-
}
\description{
umx_r_test is a wrapper around the cocor test of difference between correlations.
}
\details{
Currently it handles the test of whether r.jk and r.hm differ in magnitude.
i.e, two non-overlapping (no variable in common) correlations in the same dataset.
In the future it will be expanded to handle overlapping correlations, and to take correlation matrices as input.
}
\examples{
vars = c("mpg", "cyl", "disp", "hp")
umx_r_test(mtcars, vars)
}
